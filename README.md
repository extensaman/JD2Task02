Two mad scientists had a competition to see who could assemble more robots in 100 nights. 
For this every night each of them sends his minion to the junkyard of the robot factory for details. 
To assemble one robot they need: Head, Body, Left hand, Right hand, Left foot, Right foot, CPU, RAM, HDD.
On the first night, there are 20 random parts in the junkyard. 
Every night the factory throws 1 to 4 random parts into the landfill.
At the same time, the minions of both scientists are sent to junkyard, and each collects 1 to 4 random parts. 
If on there are no parts in the junkyard - the minions leaves with nothing.
Then they return home and give the details to the scientists.
Scientists are trying to assemble as many robots as possible from parts which they received.

Write a program that simulates this process. For simulation accept that every night comes through 100 ms.
The factory and the two minions operate at the same time.
After 100 nights (about 10 seconds) determine the winner competitions.
